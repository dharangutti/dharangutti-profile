# Modal Accessibility Isn’t Optional

**Published:** Oct 26, 2025  
**Stack:** Vanilla JS, ARIA roles, fallback demo data  
**Context:** Civic-grade calendar deployment

While deploying a celestial event calendar for public use, I audited modal behavior under real-world edge cases. The goal wasn’t just technical correctness — it was comfort-layer clarity.

Most modal implementations fail silently: no focus trap, no escape route, no ARIA roles. That’s not just bad UX — it’s a civic dignity failure.

## Custom Frameworks for Real-World Testing

Generic automation tools often fall short when testing civic-grade applications. That’s why I build **tailor-made test automation frameworks** — designed specifically for the application under test (AUT), its architecture, and its civic context.

These frameworks:
- **Mirror the AUT’s structure** for modular clarity
- **Handle edge cases** like modal stacking, fallback data, and accessibility audits
- **Integrate with ensemble-grade logging** for traceability
- **Avoid brittle selectors** by using semantic anchors and corridor-aware locators
- **Support civic transparency** by validating comfort-layer flows (e.g., keyboard-only navigation, screen reader paths)

> A custom framework isn’t overhead — it’s the difference between ceremonial testing and ensemble-grade assurance.

## Why It Matters

Test automation isn’t just about green checks. It’s about ensuring every user — regardless of device, ability, or bandwidth — experiences clarity, not confusion.

Modal accessibility and custom frameworks go hand-in-hand: both require intentional design, fallback resilience, and civic empathy.

**Next Steps:**  
I’m extending this audit to include keyboard-only navigation, screen reader flow, and modal stacking behavior. Civic-grade tools deserve ensemble-grade testing.
