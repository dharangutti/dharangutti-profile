## Custom Frameworks for Real-World Testing

Generic automation tools often fall short when testing civic-grade applications. That’s why I build **tailor-made test automation frameworks** — designed specifically for the application under test (AUT), its architecture, and its civic context.

These frameworks:
- **Mirror the AUT’s structure** for modular clarity
- **Handle edge cases** 
- **Integrate with ensemble-grade logging** 
- **Avoid brittle selectors** 
- **Support civic transparency** 

> A custom framework isn’t overhead — it’s the difference between ceremonial testing and ensemble-grade assurance.

## Why It Matters

Test automation isn’t just about green checks. It’s about ensuring every user — regardless of device, ability, or bandwidth — experiences clarity, not confusion.
