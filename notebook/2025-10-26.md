## Custom Frameworks for Real-World Testing

Generic automation tools often fall short when testing civic-grade applications. That’s why I build **tailor-made test automation frameworks** — designed specifically for the application under test (AUT), its architecture, and its civic context.

These frameworks:
- **Mirror the AUT’s structure** for modular clarity
- **Handle edge cases** like modal stacking, fallback data, and accessibility audits
- **Integrate with ensemble-grade logging** for traceability
- **Avoid brittle selectors** by using semantic anchors and corridor-aware locators
- **Support civic transparency** by validating comfort-layer flows (e.g., keyboard-only navigation, screen reader paths)

> A custom framework isn’t overhead — it’s the difference between ceremonial testing and ensemble-grade assurance.

## Why It Matters

Test automation isn’t just about green checks. It’s about ensuring every user — regardless of device, ability, or bandwidth — experiences clarity, not confusion.
